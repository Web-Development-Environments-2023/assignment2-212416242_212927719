The goal of the game is to eliminate all chickens in the time period you set (at the configuration page). also every few seconds, the movment speed of the chickens will increase (to make the game harder), also we added reload time (of 1 sec) for the spaceship.
In addition we added to the game a snowball that will drop once in a while, if the spaceship will collect the ball, the time will freeze and the chickens will stop move.
All the other rules and features to the game are specified in the 'About'.

After you finish the game (either by time out or win by eliminating all the chickens), you will be directed to the score board, there can see all your scores.
